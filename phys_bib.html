<h1>Annotated physics bibliography</h1>

A collection of reviews of physics books, based on my experience as an
undergrad in applied physics at Cornell.
My personal focus right now is on quantum chaos and mathematical physics,
and the choices here reflect that.
Sometimes there are specific references to classes at Cornell,
but they are not the focus of this page.
