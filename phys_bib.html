<h1>Annotated physics bibliography</h1>

<p>
A collection of reviews of physics texts,
based on my experience as an undergrad in applied physics at Cornell.
The intent is to point out what makes each book unique;
why it is better or worse than other books at the same level.
Organized by topic.
Within a topic, difficulty increases as you go down.

<h2>Classical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Kleppner & Kolenkow - An Introduction to Mechanics</h3>
Used in Phys 1116.

<h3>Taylor - Classical Mechanics</h3>
Used sometimes in AEP 3330 and Phys 3318.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Mechanics</h3>

<p>
The following hold for all books in the
<i>Course of Theoretical Physics</i>:
Derivations often follow from physical and symmetry principles,
or simply from intelligent mathematical fiddling.
Expects a level of physical and mathematical intuition out of the reader;
otherwise it's hard to follow along.
Beautifully written.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mechanics</i>
covers everything you would expect in an undergrad class;
there are no real gaps,
which is surprising considering how short it is.
All of its mathematical machinery is applied very elegantly,
so derivations just happen in the most natural way possible.
This is the book's greatest strength and its greatest weakness:
It feels like experiencing the way a fantastic theorist thinks,
but that doesn't necessarily prepare you to attack problems

<h3>Goldstein, Poole, & Safko - Classical Mechanics</h3>

<hr></hr>

<h2>Classical electromagnetism</h2>

<h3>Purcell & Morin - Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
Used in Phys 2217.

<h3>Griffiths - Introduction to Electrodynamics</h3>
Used in AEP 3560.

<h3>Staelin, Morgenthaler, & Kong - Electromagnetic Waves</h3>
Used in AEP 3560.

<h3>Heald & Marion - Classical Electromagnetic Radiation</h3>
Used in Phys 3327.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - The Classical Theory of Fields</h3>

<hr></hr>


<h2>Quantum mechanics</h2>

<h3>Griffiths - Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h3>
Used in AEP 3610-20 and Phys 3316-17 and 4443.

<h3>Shankar - Principles of Quantum Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Zettili - Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications</h3>

<h3>Sakurai & Napolitano - Modern Quantum Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Gottfried & Yan - Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals</h3>
Used in Phys 6572.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory</h3>

<hr></hr>

<h2>Statistical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Goodstein - States of Matter</h3>
This book is cool because it teaches by example.
The first chapter is on the fundamentals of stat mech,
but then each of the following chapters covers a specific area:
Gases, solids, liquids, exotic phases, and phase transitions.

<h3>Hill - Statistical Mechanics: Principles and & Selected Applications</h3>
A straightforward, solid book that develops all the basics of
stat mech, and then covers some topics in chemical physics.
Well-written, but dry.
It's also fairly old,
so the notation feels weird if you're used to modern books.

<h3>Sethna -
Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity</h3>

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Statistical Physics, Part 1</h3>

<h3>Lifshitz & Pitaevskii - Statistical Physics, Part 2</h3>

<hr></hr>

<h2>Fluid mechanics</h2>

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - <i>Fluid Mechanics</i></h3>
