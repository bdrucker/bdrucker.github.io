<h1>Annotated physics and applied math bibliography</h1>

<p>
A collection of reviews of physics and applied math texts,
based on my experience as an undergrad in applied physics at Cornell.
The focus is on theory, because that's what I do.
Also, I'm not sure what you can really learn about experimental physics
from a textbook.
Organized by topic.
Within each topic, the difficulty generally increases as you go down.

<h2>Classical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Kleppner & Kolenkow - An Introduction to Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Taylor - Classical Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Mechanics</h3>

<p>
Landau &amp; Lifshitz's <i>Course of Theoretical Physics</i>
contains several of the best scientific books every written.
The exposition is elegant and straightforward,
and reading one makes you feel like you're inside the mind of
a great theoretical physicist.
A degree of physical and mathematical intuition is needed
to follow along.
If you can follow along, then do so:
It'll make you better at physics.
<br>
<i>Mechanics</i> covers:
<ul>
    <li>
    An intro to Lagrangian mechanics.
    Lagrange's equations of motion are basically derived from
    physical and symmetry principles.
    </li>

    <li>
    Conservation laws, which fall out of the Lagrangian formalism.
    </li>

    <li>
    Integrals of the motion,
    with applications to simple problems.
    </li>

    <li>
    Collisions and scattering theory.
    </li>

    <li>
    Small oscillations.
    Contains interesting topics, like parametric resonance.
    </li>

    <li>
    Rigid body motion,
    including a long discussion of spinning tops.
    </li>

    <li>
    Hamiltonian mechanics,
    including action-angle variables,
    canonical transformations,
    and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
    </li>
