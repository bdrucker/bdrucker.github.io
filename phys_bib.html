<h1>Annotated physics and applied math bibliography</h1>

<p>
A collection of reviews of physics and applied math texts,
based on my experience as an undergrad in applied physics at Cornell.
The focus is on theory, because that's what I do.
Also, I'm not sure what you can really learn about experimental physics
from a textbook.
Organized by topic.
Within each topic, the difficulty generally increases as you go down.

<h2>Classical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Kleppner & Kolenkow - An Introduction to Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Taylor - Classical Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Mechanics</h3>

<p>
Landau &amp; Lifshitz's <i>Course of Theoretical Physics</i>
contains several of the best scientific books every written.
The exposition is elegant and straightforward,
and reading one makes you feel like you're inside the mind of
a great theoretical physicist.
A degree of physical and mathematical intuition is needed
to follow along.
If you can follow along, then do so:
It'll make you better at physics.
Unfortunately, the books usually contain few problems.
Furthermore, Landau's problem-solving style is difficult to imitate,
so you might find that it's not great at prepping you to
actually solve physics problems.

<i>Mechanics</i> is a short and sweet, and covers almost everything
you would want to know about classical mechanics at the undergrad level.
Lagrange's equations of motion are basically derived from physical
and symmetry principles.
Conservation laws fall out of the Lagrangian formalism effortlessly.
Integrals of the motion are discovered and then used to solve simple problems.
Collisions are developed and then applied to develop scattering theory.
The small oscillations chapter covers some cool topics,
like parametric resonance.
The chapter on rigid body motion is wonderful.
It develops clearly the powerful tools needed for a difficult topic,
and contains in-depth discussions of specific examples.
The book finishes with Hamiltonian mechanics,
including action-angle variables,
canonical transformations,
and the best discussion of the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation ever.

<h3>Goldstein, Poole, & Safko - Classical Mechanics</h3>
The canonical classical mechanics book.
A bit drier than Landau.
The math here is intended to introduce the reader to the
machinery of quantum mechanics (i.e., linear algebra).
Covers more topics than Landau,
like special relativity,
classical field theory,
and chaos.
The problems are good.
