<h1>Annotated physics bibliography</h1>

<p>
A collection of reviews of physics texts,
based on my experience as an undergrad in applied physics at Cornell.
The focus is on theory, because that's what I do.
Also, I'm not sure what you can really learn about experimental physics
from a textbook.
Organized by topic.
Within each topic, the difficulty generally increases as you go down.

<h2>Classical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Kleppner & Kolenkow - An Introduction to Mechanics</h3>
Used in Phys 1116.

<h3>Taylor - Classical Mechanics</h3>
Used sometimes in AEP 3330 and Phys 3318.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Mechanics</h3>

<p>
Landau &amp; Lifshitz's <i>Course of Theoretical Physics</i>
contains several of the best scientific books every written.
The exposition is elegant and straightforward,
and reading one makes you feel like you're inside the mind of
a great theoretical physicist.
A degree of physical and mathematical intuition is needed
to follow along.
If you can follow along, then do so:
It'll make you better at physics.
Unfortunately, the books usually contain few problems.
Furthermore, Landau's problem-solving style is difficult to imitate,
so you might find that it's not great at prepping you to
actually solve physics problems.

<p>
<i>Mechanics</i> is a short and sweet, and covers almost everything
you would want to know about classical mechanics at the undergrad level.
Lagrange's equations of motion are basically derived from physical
and symmetry principles.
Conservation laws fall out of the Lagrangian formalism effortlessly.
Integrals of the motion are discovered and then used to solve simple problems.
Collisions are developed and then applied to develop scattering theory.
The small oscillations chapter covers some cool topics,
like parametric resonance.
The chapter on rigid body motion is wonderful.
It develops clearly the powerful tools needed for a difficult topic,
and contains in-depth discussions of specific examples.
The book finishes with Hamiltonian mechanics,
including action-angle variables,
canonical transformations,
and the best discussion of the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation ever.

<h3>Goldstein, Poole, & Safko - Classical Mechanics</h3>
The canonical classical mechanics book.
A bit drier than Landau.
The math here is intended to introduce the reader to the
machinery of quantum mechanics (i.e., linear algebra).
Covers more topics than Landau,
like special relativity,
classical field theory,
and chaos.
The problems are good.

<h2>Classical electromagnetism</h2>

<h3>Purcell & Morin - Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
Used in Phys 2217.

<h3>Griffiths - Introduction to Electrodynamics</h3>
Used in AEP 3560.

<h3>Staelin, Morgenthaler, & Kong - Electromagnetic Waves</h3>
Used in AEP 3560.
The emphasis here is on applications,
but everything is derived using physical principles
rather than engineering jargon.
Staelin's notation is halfway between
"electrical engineer" and "physicist,"
and that can take some getting used to.
Covers a bunch of topics in EM waves that you won't
find in other books at this level.

<h3>Heald & Marion - Classical Electromagnetic Radiation</h3>
Used in Phys 3327.
Basically the bridge between Griffiths and Jackson.
Covers all the standard topics in greater depth and with more powerful math
than Griffiths.
There's also a lot--and I mean a lot--on waves and radiation.
It even gets into topics like waveguides and geometric optics.
The book often abuses its mathematical machinery:
The relativity and radiation sections labor through a lot
of confusing delta-function manipulations.
Honestly, if you have the math for Jackson, you can skip
from Griffiths to Jackson without worrying about this text.
It's not entirely useful as a replacement for Griffiths,
because Griffiths is 10x a better pedagogue.
That being said, there are reasons to like it
if you're in that no-man's land between
Griffiths and Jackson and really hungering for more E&amp;M.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - The Classical Theory of Fields</h3>

<h3>Landau, Lifshitz, & Pitaevskii -
Electrodynamics of Continuous Media</h3>

<h3>Jackson - Classical Electrodynamics</h3>
Used in Phys 6561.

<h2>Quantum mechanics</h2>

<h3>Griffiths - Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h3>
Used in AEP 3610-20 and Phys 3316-17 and 4443.

<h3>Shankar - Principles of Quantum Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Zettili - Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications</h3>

<h3>Sakurai & Napolitano - Modern Quantum Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Gottfried & Yan - Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals</h3>
Used in Phys 6572.

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory</h3>

<hr></hr>

<h2>Statistical mechanics</h2>

<h3>Goodstein - States of Matter</h3>
This book is cool because it teaches by example.
The first chapter is on the fundamentals of stat mech,
but then each of the following chapters covers a specific area:
Gases, solids, liquids, exotic phases, and phase transitions.
The focus on phenomenology really motivates all of the discussion
and makes the book pleasant to read.

<h3>Hill - Statistical Mechanics: Principles and & Selected Applications</h3>
A straightforward, solid book that develops all the basics of
stat mech, and then covers some cool topics in chemical physics.
Well-written, but dry.
It's also fairly old,
so its notation feels weird if you're used to modern books.

<h3>Sethna -
Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity</h3>

<h3>Landau & Lifshitz - Statistical Physics, Part 1</h3>

<h3>Lifshitz & Pitaevskii - Statistical Physics, Part 2</h3>
